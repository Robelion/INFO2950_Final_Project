    "- Is a basketball player's free throw percentage or 2-point field goal percentage a better indicator of their 3-point percentage? To investigate this we will look at the yearly statsistics of three of the best 3-point shooters in NBA history: Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, and Stephen Curry for the first 10 years of their career. We will compute two different regression models for each player using inputs free throw percentage average and 2-point field goal percentage average for the first 10 years of their career. For each player we will then determine which indicator, free throw percentage or 2-point field goal percentage projected to be a better fit for estimating 3-point percentage."
